I'm a Research Scientist in the Biophysical Modeling Group, part of the Center for Computational Biology at the Flatiron Institute. My research focuses on understanding fluid-structure interactions in complex and active fluids. Understanding the features of such systems requires utilizing a wide range of tools, most of which either do not yet exist or which don't exist in the required form. Over the past several years, I've spent time developing new numerical methods that allow rapid simulations of a wide range of complex or active fluids in nontrivial evolving geometries, deriving continuum models for dense carpets of elastic filaments immersed in fluids, and using these new tools to generate insight into the behavior of the basic mathematical equations used and the biological systems that these equations model.
