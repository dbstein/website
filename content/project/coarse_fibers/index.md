Systems of dense fibers play a pivotal role in a wide range of biological phenomenon, from mucosal clearance by ciliary pumping to the centering of the mitotic spinidle. In this project, we construct a Brinkman-like coarse grained model for beds of cilia based on local slender body theory. The model permits analytic
